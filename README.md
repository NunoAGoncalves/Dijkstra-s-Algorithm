# Uniform Cost Search Java

This ia a program for Uniform Cost Search implemented into Java.

This program was made during an alternative assessement from the University of Bath due to COVID-19. As such, the majority of the code has been created by the professors. All the code that directly influences the "questions" in the unit testing have been made by me.
